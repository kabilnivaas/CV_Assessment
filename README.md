# **CV_Assessment**  

A **deep learning-based image classification** project using **PyTorch**. This repository contains code for training a neural network model, saving the trained model, and preparing for future deployment via a REST API.  

🚀 **Current Progress:** Model training completed!  
🔜 **Next Steps:** Integrating a FastAPI-based REST API for making predictions.  

---

## **📌 Project Overview**  

This project focuses on **image classification** using **deep learning**. The main components include:  

✅ **Model Training**: Built a classification model using PyTorch and trained it on **FashionMNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets.  
✅ **Saving the Model**: After training, the model is saved as `fast_model.pth`.  
🛠 **Next Steps**: REST API development with **FastAPI**, basic authentication, and deployment using **Docker**.

## **🚀 How to Set Up the Project**  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
First, download the project by cloning this GitHub repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kabilnivaas/CV_Assessment.git
cd CV_Assessment
```

### **2️⃣ Install Required Dependencies**  
Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed. Then, install the required packages using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install essential libraries like **PyTorch, torchvision, and FastAPI** (for future REST API development).  

### **3️⃣ Train the Model**  
To train the model, run:  
```bash
python train.py
```
This will:  
✔ Train a deep learning model using **PyTorch**  
✔ Save the trained model as **`fast_model.pth`**

## **🛠 Future Plans & Improvements**  

Now that the model is trained, the next steps include:  

🔹 **Integrating FastAPI** – To create an API endpoint (`/predict`) that allows users to upload an image and get predictions from the trained model.  
🔹 **Basic Authentication** – Adding API key-based authentication for security.  
🔹 **Testing with Postman/CURL** – Ensuring the API works correctly before deployment.  
🔹 **Dockerization** – Packaging the project into a Docker container for easy deployment.
